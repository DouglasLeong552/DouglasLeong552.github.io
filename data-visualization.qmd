## Example Visualization

This page presents a data visualization created during my studies to demonstrate how quantitative data can be effectively visualized and interpreted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dataset

The dataset used in this visualization represents academic performance scores recorded annually from 2019 to 2024.\
The values are numerical and are used to illustrate how performance changes over time.
